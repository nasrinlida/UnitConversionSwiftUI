# UnitConversionSwiftUI
This is the second application using SwiftUI but the first app that is completely designed by me.

This is a simple conversion application to convert time from many of its units into other units.

I have used a TextField for input amount by the user. There are also two segmented control as User Interaction controls
so that the user can select their desired units one for the inpu and the other one for output. There exists a TextView also
that shows the output .

Special technique that I have used in this app like my previous app WeSplitSwiftUI is the Two-way bindings using property wrapper @State.
